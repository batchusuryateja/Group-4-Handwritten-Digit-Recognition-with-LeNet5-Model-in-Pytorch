# Handwritten Digit Classification using CNN, MLP & LeNet 5
##### This project focuses on the classification of handwritten digits using three different models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the LeNet-5 model. The goal is to compare the performance and effectiveness of these neural network architectures on the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems.

### Using Python Libraries:
##### sklearn
##### opencv 
##### PIL
##### numpy
##### pandas
