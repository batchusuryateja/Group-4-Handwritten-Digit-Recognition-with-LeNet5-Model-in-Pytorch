# Handwritten Digit Classification using CNN, MLP & LeNet 5
#### This project focuses on the classification of handwritten digits using three different models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the LeNet-5 model. The goal is to compare the performance and effectiveness of these neural network architectures on the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Using Python Libraries:
##### Sklearn
##### OpenCV
##### PIL
##### NumPy
##### Pandas

## Data Collection:

#### The MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification, is used in this project. It comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Loading MNIST Dataset:

#### To load the MNIST dataset, we utilize the tensorflow.keras.datasets module, which provides a straightforward interface for fetching the dataset. The dataset is split into training and test sets.
